# 📄 AI Document Risk & Compliance Analyzer for SMBs

## 🚀 Description

Small businesses, startups, and independent professionals often sign legal documents such as **vendor contracts, rental agreements, and employment offers** without fully understanding the risks involved. Legal language is complex, lawyers are expensive, and decisions are frequently made under time pressure.

**AI Document Risk & Compliance Analyzer for SMBs** is an AI-powered web application that helps users **understand contracts before signing**. Using Google’s **Gemini AI**, the platform analyzes legal documents, flags risky clauses, explains them in plain language, and supports informed decision-making.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This application provides **decision support only** and **does not provide legal advice**. Users should consult qualified legal professionals before making legal decisions.
